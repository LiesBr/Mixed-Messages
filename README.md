# Mixed-Messages 

## Background

This small program was developed as a part of the codecademy full stack developer course. The objective was to make a random message generator. 
My inspiration came from my 1,5 year old daughter, who knows about 20 words, and will combine them randomly to make "sentences". 

## Technologies used
JS mostly, very basic html and css.
Also a practice in version control via terminal
